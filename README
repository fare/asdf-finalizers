ASDF-FINALIZERS

This library allows you to implement and enforce proper finalization
of compile-time constructs while building Lisp source files.
It depends on ASDF 2.22.1 or later.

TODO:
(1) Actually implement.
(2) Add a test suite with examples.
(3) Test it.
(4) Add more corner cases.
(5) Add XCVB support.


==== Exported Functionality ====

asdf-finalizers defines and uses package ASDF-FINALIZERS.
It uses ASDF 2.22.1's :around-compile hook mechanism and
the :compile-check extension to its compile-file* to build stuff.
